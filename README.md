This is a Line Following Robot that uses photoresistors to read black lines and drive the motors accordingly. This robot was worked on in a team of four, and developed in accordance with the ECE 05 curriculem.
Our robot placed 2nd in the loops race (based on number of loops completed within a certain time limit), 2nd in drag race (a straight-away speed competition), and passed the frequency sweep, (a race 
based on precision). 
The reason we did not place in frequency sweep is due to the fact that our motor had burnt out during the race, forcing us to miss the competition; however, through perserverance, we were able to replace the 
motor and finish 2nd in the rest of the races.
